Placeholder Tutorial
=========================================

In this example we will do absolutely nothing, because its a placeholder!

Requirements
------------
This tutorial requires nothing of you, absolutely nothing! Great, right?
In case you want to do something though, you can ``pip`` install this package.
You don't need to though::

    pip install numpy


.. note::
    This is a note.

# OK Fine. Here's an example of how to do something.
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Code can be included either commented (won't execute but shows up as code in
# document) as follows::
#
#   import nibabel as nib
#   import numpy as np
#
#
# Or code can be included as actual, executable code.

import brainstat

print(brainstat)

# That's it that's all folks.
